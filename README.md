# BagelBot
BagelBot is a fully and forever undetected Rasberry Pi based triggerbot. It can be used for any game with a colored outline, most notably Valorant and Overwatch
It runs no software on the host computer and can be built for about $75.
It is impossible for any anticheat to ever detect it non-heuristically, as it is indistinguishable from a normal mouse and monitor.
Full build guide is coming once the project is finished (a few days from now).
