# BagelBot
BagelBot is an undetected Rasberry Pi based/2pc triggerbot. It can be used for any game with a colored outline, most notably Valorant and Overwatch
It runs no software on the host computer and can be built for about $100.
It should be impossible for any anticheat to ever detect it non-heuristically.

Coming soon:
- Support with 2 pcs and no Raspberry Pi
- Code rewritten and compiled in Cython for better performance
- Maybe aimbot if I can figure it out (will likely take months if I do)
